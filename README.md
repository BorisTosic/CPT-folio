# CPT-folio

I am going to be creating a web application where you can place an order for equipment or tools, e.g. impact drivers or replacement batteries, and they will be delivered to your door within 30 min. There will be a homepage with recommended tools, recent purchases, specials and popular store pages. There will also be a search page where you can search for specific products and compare and choose identical products from different stores near you. Alternatively you can also search for types of tools and find all of the different ones that are offered and filter by brand, cost, store, ect. There will also be a basket page where you can see and edit all of your items and you can pay which sends you to a form that gets the userâ€™s payment information. There will also be an account and settings page where you can edit the user settings, payment history and see how long your order has until it arrives.
